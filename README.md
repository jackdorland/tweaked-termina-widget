# Tweaked `vecnehladny/ubersicht-termina-widget`
My tweaked version of [vecnehladny/ubersicht-termina-widget](https://github.com/vecnehladny/ubersicht-termina-widget)

Solid color background, less color, overall more terminal-feeling.

Color scheme is made to match my current background. Feel free to change it.

## Instalation
1. Download and install Übersicht from their [website](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/)
2. Clone this repository or download a [zip file](terminal.widget.zip)
```
git clone https://github.com/jackdorland/tweaked-termina-widget ~/Library/Application\ Support/Übersicht/widgets/jackdorland-termina-widget/
```

## Customization
You can set brightness of the neon effect through the `brightness` variable.
I was *slightly* lazy while making my changes and didn't make them accessable through a config file/global CSS variables. Feel free to edit each hex as you see fit.
